CEC 6.1.2 ACK (Acknowledge)
The ACK bit is used by Follower(s) to acknowledge the data or Header Block. It is always set to 1 by the
Initiator. It operates in one of two modes:
For messages addressed to a single device:
* A Follower that reads its own address in the Destination address field shall acknowledge with a ‘0’ ACK
bit.
* All other devices shall not assert the ACK bit to logical ‘0’.
* A ‘0’ read by the Initiator therefore indicates a successful transmission of the data or Header Block.
For broadcast messages the sense of the ACK bit is inverted to allow for a single device to reject a message:
* All Followers that do not want to reject the message shall not assert the ACK bit to logical ‘0’.
* A ‘1’ read by the Initiator therefore indicates that no device has rejected the data or Header Block – the
message transmission can therefore continue if required.
* A Follower that wants to reject a broadcast message shall generate a ’0’ ACK bit.
* A ‘0’ read by the Initiator therefore indicates that one or more devices have rejected the message. 


CEC 7.1 Frame Re-transmissions
"A valid frame is considered lost and therefore may be re-transmitted under the following conditions:
* If a frame is not acknowledged in a directly addressed message.
* If a frame is negatively acknowledged in a broadcast message.
* If the Initiator detects low impedance on the CEC line when it is transmitting high impedance and is not
expecting a Follower asserted bit.
Re-transmission can be attempted up to 5 times for a single message and shall be attempted at least once.
The re-transmission shall be after a signal free time as described in CEC Table 4. If the re-transmission is as
a result of a <Polling Message> for a secondary task (see section CEC 12.2), then it is recommended to send
only one re-transmission.
The Re-transmission mechanism shall only be used for transport errors such as frame not ACK’d (i.e. it has
not been positively acknowledged or has been negatively acknowledged, according to message addressing,
see above). It shall not be used for application errors, e.g. in response to a <Feature Abort> or an incorrect or
unexpected application response - see section CEC 12.2, Protocol General Rules and section CEC 12.3,
Feature Abort. "

For directly addressed message send not AKNOWLEDGED. Need to differentiate to "bus busy". True if ACKed. False if not ACKed.
4 more client attemps if not ACKed.

For <Polling Message> 1 retry by device. Client can then assume 

CEC 7.2 Flow Control
"To provide flow control, a receiving device may negatively acknowledge any data or Header Block it is at
present unable to process. A negative acknowledge will cause re-transmission by the Initiator. "

CEC 9 Arbitration

"Before attempting to transmit or re-transmit a frame, a device shall ensure that the CEC line has been
inactive for a number of bit periods"

"A device that has lost arbitration shall stop transmitting and become a Follower. The device shall then wait for
the CEC line to be inactive for the signal free time period as specified in CEC Table 4, before attempting to
send another message. "

This is "bus busy". Device retries once. If still busy return bus busy. 

CEC 9.2 Message Time Constraints
"There are certain time constraints for messages that should be obeyed at application level. These are a
desired maximum response time of 200ms and a required maximum response time of 1 second. "

Use of feature abort.
=====================
broadcast NACK.

The CEC device should not NACK any CEC broadcast message.
The client should recieve the received broadcast message. The client will ignore it if unsupported or not useful to execute it.

<Feature abort> looks to be only sued for directly addressed message.

CEC 12.3 Feature Abort
For a broadcast message:
* A Follower that receives a broadcast message which it does not support, ignores the received message,
and does not send a <Feature Abort>.
For a directly addressed message:
* <Feature Abort> is used as a response to any failure.

8.5 Hot Plug Detect Signal
An HDMI Sink shall not assert high voltage level on its Hot Plug Detect pin when the E-EDID is not
available for reading. This requirement shall be fulfilled at all times, even if the Sink is powered-off
or in standby. The Hot Plug Detect pin may be asserted only when the +5V Power line from the
Source is detected. This will ensure that the Hot Plug Detect pin is not asserted before the Third
Make of the connector (see Section 4.1.5).
A Source may use a high voltage level Hot Plug Detect signal to initiate the reading of E-EDID
data.
A Source shall assume that any voltage within the range specified for High voltage level in Table
4-39 indicates that a Sink is connected and that E-EDID is readable. It does not indicate whether
or not the Sink is powered or whether or not the HDMI input on the Sink is selected or active.
An HDMI Sink shall indicate any change to the contents of the E-EDID by driving a low voltage
level pulse on the Hot Plug Detect pin. This pulse shall be at least 100 msec.

HPD asserted (driven high voltage) when source provides +5V Power line from Source.
Sink should only assert HPD if EDID is available.

What happens to added logical adddresses when.
Source
    HPD is de-asserted?
    Standby?
    Power cycle - all lost start again.
    Device is closed - all lost start again.
Sink
    +5V from source is not detected?
    standby?
    Power cycle - start again.
    Device is closed - all lost start again.

8.7.3 CEC Physical Address Discovery Algorithm
The following algorithm is used to allocate the physical address of each device whenever HPD is
de-asserted or upon power-up:
Disable assertion of HPD to all source devices
If I am CEC root
 Set my_address to 0.0.0.0
Else
 Wait for HPD from sink
 Query sink for my_address of my connection (Section 8.7.4)
 The device shall retain this physical address until HPD is
 removed (or the device is powered off).
End if

If device has connections for source devices then
 Label all possible connections to source devices uniquely starting from connection_label = 1 to the number of source input connections
 If device has separate EDIDs for each source connection then
    If my_address ends with 0 then
        Set each source_physical_address to my_address with the first 0 being replaced with connection_label.
    Else (i.e. beyond the fifth layer of the tree)
        Set each source_physical_address to F.F.F.F
    End if
 Else
    Set each source_physical_address to my_address
 End if
 Write source_physical_address to HDMI VSDB in EDID for each source
 connection
End if
Allow HPD to be asserted for source devices
