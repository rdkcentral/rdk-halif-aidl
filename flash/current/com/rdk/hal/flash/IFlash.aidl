     * Flashes a firmware image file onto the device.
     * 
     * The image file could contain an application image, 
     * disaster recovery image, bootloader or bootloader splash screen image.
     * 
     * The types of images that are supported is platform dependent and the
     * type is detected by examination of the file.
     * 
     * The `flashImageFromFile()` function is non-blocking and requests the 
     * flashing of an image file in background.
     * 
     * The progress of the flashing operation is provided in the 
     * `IFlashListener` listener callbacks.
     * 
     * Only one background flashing operation is supported at any time.
     * 
     * The image file is:
     *  - Checked for existence.
     *  - Checked to be a valid flash image file.
     *  - Signature verified.
     *  - Checked to be the correct size for the target flash area.
     *  - Checked to be targeted at and compatible with the product.
     * 
     * The background flashing operation shall run at a priority which does not
     * impact foreground audio, video or graphics operations.
     * 
     * Once the background image flashing operation has completed successfully, the new 
     * image is flagged as the preferred chosen image when next loaded and run.
     * 
     * @param[in] filename      Filename of the image.
     * @param[in] listener      IFlashListener instance for callbacks.
     * 
     * @returns boolean
     * @retval true     The image file flash request was started.
     * @retval false    The image file flash request was not started because a flash
     *                  operation is already in progress.
