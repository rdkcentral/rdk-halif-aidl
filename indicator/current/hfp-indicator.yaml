# HAL Feature Profile for Indicator

# **
# * HAL Feature Profile for the indicator service.
# *
# * This section defines the feature profile for the indicator Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
# * It specifies the interface version, multi-instance support, and the list of supported states
# * for the indicator component.
# *
# * This is a reference file and is expected to be used to define the platform-specific requirements.
# * It is also consumed by automated test systems and middleware components to determine
# * the valid set of states for the indicator service on a given device.
# *
# * For RDK reference implementations, the indicator is designed to reflect the global state
# * of the device, therefore only a single indicator instance is provided. However, the interface
# * supports multi-instance configurations for third-party vendors who may require independent
# * indicator control (e.g., per-zone indicators).
