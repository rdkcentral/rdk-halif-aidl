# HAL Feature Profile for Indicator

# **
# * HAL Feature Profile for the indicator service.
# *
# * This section defines the feature profile for the indicator Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).
# * It specifies the interface version, multi-instance support, and the list of supported states
# * for the indicator component.
# *
# * This is a reference file and is expected to be used to define the platform-specific requirements.
# * It is also consumed by automated test systems and middleware components to determine
# * the valid set of states for the indicator service on a given device.
# *
# * For RDK reference implementations, the indicator is designed to reflect the global state
# * of the device, therefore only a single indicator instance is provided. However, the interface
# * supports multi-instance configurations for third-party vendors who may require independent
# * indicator control (e.g., per-zone indicators).

indicator:
  interfaceVersion: current
  
  # Multi-instance support
  # The interface architecture supports multi-instance configurations.
  # Each instance represents an independent indicator resource.
  #
  # RDK reference implementation:
  # - Provides a single global indicator instance (ID: 0)
  # - This reflects the global state of the device
  #
  # Third-party vendor multi-instance example:
  # - Vendors may configure multiple independent instances
  # - Example: per-zone indicators, per-function indicators, etc.
  # - Each instance can be controlled independently
  #
  # RDK reference implementation (single instance):
  instances:
    - Id: 0
      name: "global"
      description: "Global device state indicator"
  
  # Multi-instance example (commented out - not used in RDK reference):
  # To enable a second instance, uncomment:
  #   - Id: 1
  #     name: "zone1"
  #     description: "Zone-specific indicator"
  
  # Supported state strings
  # These map to the state names from the previous State enum
  supportedStates:
    # General system states
    - "BOOT"
    - "ACTIVE"
    - "STANDBY"
    - "OFF"
    - "DEEP_SLEEP"

    # WPS-related states
    - "WPS_CONNECTING"
    - "WPS_CONNECTED"
    - "WPS_ERROR"
    - "WPS_SES_OVERLAP"

    # Network and connectivity states
    - "WIFI_ERROR"
    - "IP_ACQUIRED"
    - "NO_IP"

    # System operation and maintenance
    - "FULL_SYSTEM_RESET"
    - "USB_UPGRADE"
    - "SOFTWARE_DOWNLOAD_ERROR"

    # Fault or diagnostics
    - "PSU_FAILURE"
