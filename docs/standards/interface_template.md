# HAL Interface Name

## Overview

Describe the role of this HAL service. Outline its responsibilities, how it abstracts platform-specific functionality, and its interaction with higher-level RDK components. Mention any excluded modes or operations.

## Functional Overview

Explain the main responsibilities of this interface, such as managing resources, processing buffers, handling events, or controlling hardware. Clarify its positioning in the system architecture.

## Initialization

Describe startup behaviour, service registration, dependencies, and order of operation (e.g., Service Manager registration).

---

## Product Customization

Explain:

* How resources are uniquely identified and enumerated
* What `Capabilities` or properties clients can query
* If the platform can offer multiple simultaneous instances

---

## System Context

Include a Mermaid flowchart or textual description showing:

* Client-side interface use
* Resource control paths
* Event listener connections
* Any shared data buffer interaction

---

## Resource Management

Detail the lifecycle:

* How clients `open()` or `acquire()` resource handles
* Restrictions (e.g., single controller vs. multiple listeners)
* Cleanup behavior when a client exits

---

## Operation and Data Flow

General description of:

* How input/output flows through the HAL
* Handling of any buffer queues, frame handles, or metadata
* Conditions for back pressure or resource stalls

---

## Modes of Operation

Describe configurable or runtime modes and how they affect client interaction or output.

---

## Event Handling

Document:

* Events emitted (e.g., `onStateChanged`, `onError`, `onResourceAvailable`)
* Listener types
* Timing guarantees or event ordering rules

---

## State Machine / Lifecycle

Describe the typical session flow:

* States like `CLOSED`, `READY`, `STARTED`, `FLUSHING`
* Sequence diagrams or state transition tables
* Expected order of calls and callbacks

---

## Data Format / Protocol Support (if applicable)

| Format  | Use Case         | Support Level |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------- |
| FormatX | Application data | Optional      |

---

## Platform Capabilities

Outline expected feature supportâ€”parameter ranges, configuration values, or mode toggles exposed through `PlatformCapabilities`.

---

## End-of-Stream and Error Handling

Explain how the interface handles:

* Completion signals
* Error propagation and recovery
* Discontinuities or out-of-band resets

---

## Open Issues / TODOs

Track:

* Unspecified behaviour
* Items pending AIDL changes or implementation
* Gaps in validation/test coverage
