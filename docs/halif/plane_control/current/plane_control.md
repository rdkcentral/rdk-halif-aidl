# Plane Control

The Plane Control HAL manages the platform’s video and graphics plane resources, exposing each plane as a resource with readable capabilities.  

It enables linking video sources—such as video sinks, HDMI input, and composite input—to a video plane. Additionally, it provides the RDK middleware with a native window graphics plane handle for EGL-based graphics display.  

Each plane is configurable through a set of properties that clients can read or modify, either individually or in batches.

## Initialization

The [systemd](../../../vsi/systemd/current/intro.md) `hal-plane_control.service` unit file is provided by the vendor layer to start the service and should include [Wants](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Wants=) or [Requires](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/latest/systemd.unit.html#Requires=)  directives to start any platform driver services it depends upon.

The Plane Control service depends on the Service Manager to register itself as a service.

Upon starting, the service shall register the `IPlaneControl` interface with the Service Manager using the String `IPlaneControl.serviceName` and immediately become operational.

## Product Customization

- The `IPlaneControl.getCapabilities()` returns an array of `Capabilities` parcelables to uniquely represent all of the plane resources supported by the vendor layer.
  - Typically, the plane index (resource ID) value starts at 0 for the first video plane and increments by 1 for each additional video plane, followed by the graphic plane(s).
- The `Capabilities` parcelable returned by the `IPlaneControl.getCapabilities()` function lists all capabilities supported by a plane resource.
- Concurrent control of plane resources is allowed by multiple clients. The RDK middleware is responsible for ensuring only 1 controlling client is active at any given time.

## System Context

The Plane Control service provides functionality to multiple clients which exist inside the RDK middleware.

Typically, video planes are linked to video sources when a GStreamer pipeline is created in the RDK middleware. The geometry of the video planes can be manipulated by the Window Manager through a separate client connection.

Native graphics plane windows are taken by the RDK middleware compositor to link graphics display updates from EGL to the hardware.

## Resource Management

The `IPlaneControl` interface provides access to all of the plane resource instances offered by the platform.

Each plane resource instance is assigned a unique integer resource ID or index, which is used in the `IPlaneControl` function calls to indicate which plane is being accessed.

Any number of clients can access the `IPlaneControl` service and access plane settings.

The diagram below shows the relationship between the interface and resource instances.

## Plane Types and Fixed Configuration

For the 2 types of planes (video and graphics) there are fixed configurations which they are expected to hold.

|Plane Type | Fixed Configuration|
|-----------|--------------------|
| **Video** |If there is no video to display on a visible plane, then it shall render transparent black. <br>The z-order is dynamic only for video planes.<br> Primary video plane shall always be listed at resource index 0.|
| **Graphics** |Calls to `getNativeGraphicsWindowHandle()` will return a handle that can be used to connect with EGL display implementations.|

## Video Planes

Video sources (video sinks, HDMI inputs, and composite inputs) can be mapped to destination video planes for presentation.

A video plane can only be mapped to one video source at a time, and any attempt to set additional video sources shall fail.

A call to the `setVideoSourceDestinationPlaneMapping()` allows for multiple sources and planes to be mapped and can perform complex operations such as plane swapping between main and PIP video.

The sequence of calls below shows how man video and PIP video can be mapped separately and then swapped.

### Main Video on Plane 0

- The main video using video sink 0 is displayed on video plane 0. 
- AV playback is started.

```c++
SourcePlaneMapping[] =
{
    sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
    sourceIndex = 0,
    destinationPlaneIndex = 0
}
```

### 2. PIP Video on Plane 1

- The PIP video using video sink 1 is displayed on video plane 1.
- AV playback is started.

```c++
SourcePlaneMapping[] =
{
    sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
    sourceIndex = 1,
    destinationPlaneIndex = 1
}
```

### 3a. Swapping Main and PIP Planes

- First variant: The destination plane indices for main and PIP are swapped in a single call.

```c++
SourcePlaneMapping[] =
{
  sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
  sourceIndex = 0,
  destinationPlaneIndex = 1
},
{
  sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
  sourceIndex = 1,
  destinationPlaneIndex = 0
}
```

### 3b. Unmapping Main and Moving PIP

- Second variant: The destination plane index for PIP is moved to plane 0 and main is unmapped.

```c++
SourcePlaneMapping[] =
{
    sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
    sourceIndex = 0,
    destinationPlaneIndex = -1 // -1 indicates unmapping
},
{
    sourceType = "SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK",
    sourceIndex = 1,
    destinationPlaneIndex = 0
}
```

## Stopping Video Display

When video is being stopped, the video source must also be unmapped from the plane.

The `setVideoSourceDestinationPlaneMapping()` function can be used to unmap one or more video sources from planes.

- Video sink 0 is unmapped from plane 0.

```c++
SourcePlaneMapping[]=
{
    sourceType = SOURCE_VIDEO_SINK, 
    sourceIndex = 0, 
    destinationPlaneIndex = -1
}
```

## Z-Order

The default z-order for planes is linked to their resource ID (index).

The z-order can be changed by setting the `ZORDER` property on a plane.

Higher z-order planes display over the top of lower z-order planes.

A virtual background plane of opaque black or ultra-black (RGB=0,0,0 or YUV=0,0,0) shall be used to display when no plane pixel is visible above it.

The diagram below shows a typical default plane resource configuration for 2 video planes and a single graphics plane.

![z-order](./z-order-layering.png)

## Compositor

The compositor blends the raster in the visible planes using z-order and alpha settings to produce a single output display image.

For STB devices, the display image is scaled and output over HDMI, and for TV devices, it is scaled and displayed on the panel.

## Plane Dimensions & Geometry Control

When properties affecting the plane geometry are changed by the client, they shall take immediate effect on the next available vsync.

## Alpha Blending

Where a plane is configured to use a translucent alpha setting (`Property::ALPHA = 1..254`), the porter-duff operation shall be `OVER` using pre-multiplied alpha.

## Plane Display Latency

The `vsyncDisplayLatency` in `Capabilities` indicates the delay of video or graphics presentation changes before final output.
