# **HAL API Deprecation Governance Process**

**Objective**

This document defines the governance process for managing the lifecycle of HAL APIs through deprecation and eventual removal. It outlines how HAL API deprecations will be communicated, documented, validated, and executed in a controlled and visible manner. This ensures backward compatibility during transition periods, minimises risk, and provides clear guidance to engineering teams on the required steps and responsibilities throughout the deprecation process.

---

## **Step 1: Soft Deprecation**

#### **Header Annotation**

- Move API declaration to a clearly marked **Deprecated APIs** section in HAL header files.  
- Use Doxygen `@deprecated` tag with:
      - Deprecation date (e.g. `@deprecated Deprecated since 2025-04-01`)
      - Replacement API if available (e.g. `Use NewHALAPI_DoTask() instead.`)
      - Example:
         ```c
         /**
         * @deprecated Deprecated since 2025-04-01. Use NewHALAPI_DoTask() instead.
         */
         void OldHALAPI_DoTask();
         ```
   - This allows IDEs (such as VSCode) to highlight deprecated APIs automatically. Recommended VSCode extensions:
     - **Doxygen Documentation Generator**
     - **Better C++ Syntax**
     - **C/C++ (Microsoft)** (recognises Doxygen tags)

#### **Compiler Warning**

- Wrap deprecated function in a deprecation macro to trigger warnings in builds:
   ```
   WARNING: DEPRECATED FUNCTION <API> USED. Please migrate.
   ```

#### **Runtime Logging**

- Log usage at runtime:
   ```
   ERROR: DEPRECATED FUNCTION <API> USED.
   ```

#### **Module Documentation**

- Review and update any related Markdown documentation for the HAL module to reflect the deprecation status.
- Ensure deprecated APIs are clearly marked and guidance on replacements is provided.

---

## **Step 2: HAL Validation & Documentation**

### **VTS Adjustment**  

- When an API is marked deprecated, its function tests must continue to exist and be executed until the API is fully removed.
- Removal of function tests from the HAL Validation Test Suite (VTS) may only occur once the header file version without the deprecated API has been released.
- The new header file version must not be consumed or published externally until the corresponding VTS version is also ready and aligned.
- Document the deprecated API in VTS documentation for reference.
- Create a dedicated Deprecated APIs Section in VTS Release Notes that lists:
      - API Name
      - Deprecation Date
      - Replacement API (if available)

### **HAL Release Notes**  

- Create a dedicated **Deprecated APIs Section** in the HAL Release Notes that lists:
      - API Name
      - Deprecation Date
      - Replacement API (if available)

### **Communicate Deprecation**  

- Inform all relevant engineering stakeholders. IDE + Doxygen warnings will provide developer visibility.

---

## **Step 3: Deprecation Ticketing**

### **Deprecation Ticket**

- Title: "Deprecate `<API Name>`"  
- Include:
   - Rationale
   - Target removal release version
   - Replacement guidance
   - Deprecation date

### **Assignment & Tracking**

- Assign to relevant HAL engineering teams.

---

## **Step 4: Hard Removal**

> *A deprecated API may only be removed after at least one release cycle (or defined period) with no active consumers.*

### **Major Version Bump**

- Increment HAL major version to signal breaking change (e.g. v5.0.0 â†’ v6.0.0).
- Document removal in unified Release Notes, and update the Deprecated APIs sections accordingly.

### **Code & Test Cleanup**

- Fully remove declaration, implementation, and related HAL tests.

### **Verification**

- HAL CI and build/test pass criteria validated post-removal.

### Module Documentation

- Ensure all relevant Markdown documentation is updated to remove references to the deprecated API.

---

## **Step 5: Final Verification & Ticket Closure**

### **Final Verification**

- Ensure HAL layer builds and passes validation.

### **Ticket Resolution**

- Close the Deprecation Ticket upon verification.

---

## **Step 6: Emergency Exceptions**

If urgent removal is necessary (e.g. security risks):

1. **Document Rationale** in the Deprecation Ticket.
2. **Obtain Explicit Sign-Off** from Principal Architect and QA.
3. **Accelerated Execution** of HAL removal.
