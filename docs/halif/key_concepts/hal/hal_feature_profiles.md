# HAL Feature Profile (HFP)

The HAL Feature Profile (HFP) is a YAML-based declaration provided by OEMs to define the capabilities of their vendor layer implementation. It serves critical functions:

* **Test Driver Configuration:** Enables the vendor test suite to perform targeted testing based on the declared feature set.
* **Capability Declaration:** Provides a comprehensive list of supported HAL features for verification against product requirements.

Each HAL component defines its own `hfp_xxx.yaml` within the vendor layer deliverables, typically located in a configuration directory (e.g., `vendor/<vendor_name>/<platform>/config/`).

## Role in HFP Files

Each platform is expected to define and maintain its own HAL Feature Profile (HFP) YAML file for the indicator component, tailored to its specific hardware and software configuration. The HFP plays a critical role in three areas:

### Test Configuration Input

The HFP informs the HAL compliance and validation framework about which features and states are supported. Test suites dynamically adjust coverage based on the declared capabilities, ensuring accurate and meaningful validation.

### Interface Capability Declaration

The HFP acts as a machine-readable contract between the platform vendor and RDK middleware. It indicates which parts of the AIDL interface are implemented, and allows middleware to query feature support during runtime or setup.

### Operational Semantics and Return Values

For interfaces like `getCapabilities()` that return a list of platform-supported features, the HFP provides the authoritative source of truth. It defines what capabilities are expected to appear in the returned listâ€”even when they are not explicitly defined in the AIDL schema. Developers and testers use the HFP to understand expected return values, implementation constraints, and platform-specific extensions.

Maintaining the HFP in sync with the actual implementation and runtime behaviour is essential for consistent integration, accurate testing, and correct feature negotiation between system components.

## File Syntax and Schema

The HFP utilizes YAML syntax for structured data representation. This is an example format; actual formats are defined per component.

```yaml

## Mandatory and Optional HALs and Features

The HFP explicitly lists all supported HAL components. Components or specific features within them can be marked as `mandatory` to indicate their requirement status. Any field not defined can be assumed to be `false` but for clarity can also be stated explicitly:

```yaml
hal:
  components:
    cdm:
      mandatory: true
      resources:
        PlayReady:
          version: "4.4"
          mandatory: true
        WideVine:
          version: "L3"
          mandatory: false
```

## HFP Versioning

The `schema_version` field adheres to semantic versioning (major.minor.patch) to ensure backward compatibility as the HFP schema evolves.

## Tooling

Dedicated tools are essential for creating and validating the HFP:

* **Schema Validation:** Implements robust validation against a defined schema (e.g., JSON Schema).
* **HFP Generator:** Tool to help create HFP files.
