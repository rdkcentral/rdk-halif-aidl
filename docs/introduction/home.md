**RDK-AIDL-HAL** upgrades the RDK architecture with **Android AIDL** for a modern, modular, and interoperable Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL).

## Why AIDL for HAL?

### AIDL enhances HAL with:

- **Consistent APIs** across hardware.
- **Efficient IPC** between system and HAL.
- **Cross-platform integration** with Android.
- **Modular and scalable development.**

### Features

- **AIDL-based HAL**: Standardized IPC for hardware communication.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on low-power devices.
- **Security**: Secure IPC between HAL and system.
- **Scalability & Performance**: Simplifies updates, reduces latency.
