# HAL Feature Profile (HFP) - Far Field Voice (FFV) Maximum Configuration Reference
#  This file establishes the baseline maximum configuration for the Far Field Voice (FFV) component, serving as a worst-case scenario reference for test suite execution.
#  Platform-specific FFV configurations, tailored to unique hardware and software requirements, are derived from this reference. 
#     During testing, these platform-specific HFP files are used to validate accurate reporting of supported FFV capabilities by the interface.
#  The FFV interface's runtime behavior is managed by an internal state machine, ensuring adherence to the declared configurations.
