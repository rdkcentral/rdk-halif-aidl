# The purpose of this file is used to give a worse case scenario example of the max configuration used for the vComponent and for the testing suites.
# Based on the platform these details will be configured specifically as required. The platform specific details start by using this reference and re-defining the requirements based on platform.
# During the testing, this file is used ( the platform specific version ), to check the capabilities of the interface are being returned correctly for the given platform.
# The internal state machine will control the behaviour of the interface.
